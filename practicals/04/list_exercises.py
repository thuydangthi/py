First check the security. Copy the following list of usernames:
   usernames = ['jimbo', 'giltson98', 'derekf', 'WhatSup', 'NicolEye', 'swei45', 'BaseInterpreterInterface',
    'BaseStdIn', 'Command', 'ExecState', 'InteractiveConsole', 'InterpreterInterface', 'StartServer', 'bob']
Ask the user for their username. If the username is in the above list of authorised users,
print "Access granted", otherwise print "Access denied".

If the user authenticates successfully prompts the user for 5 numbers and then stores each of these in a list called numbers.
The program should then output information about these numbers, as in the output below.
Note that you can use the functions min, max, sum and len, and you can use the append method to add a number to a list.
